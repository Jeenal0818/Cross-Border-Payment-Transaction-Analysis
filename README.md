# 💸 Cross-Border Payment Transaction Analyzer  

This project demonstrates how to analyze **cross-border payment transactions** using **CrewAI**.  
It simulates a payment transaction flow, evaluates associated risks, and produces a clean **Markdown report** with clear headings and bullet points.

## 📌 Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to automate the analysis of international transactions between banks.  
Key aspects include:  
- Parsing **transaction details** (amount, country, banks, currencies).  
- Running the **CrewAI pipeline** with agents and tasks.  
- Generating an **AI-driven analysis** (risk score and reasoning).  
- Returning results directly in **Markdown format** (easy to read, structured, and GitHub-ready).  

This makes the project useful for:  
- **Financial risk analysts**  
- **Compliance teams** (AML, fraud detection, regulatory checks)  
- **Developers** experimenting with CrewAI

## ⚙️ Features  

- ✅ Define cross-border transaction details as structured inputs.  
- ✅ Run analysis with **CrewAI agent + task** execution.  
- ✅ Output a **Markdown report** with:  
  - Transaction details  
  - Risk assessment  
  - AI-generated reasoning  
- ✅ Simple, extensible structure to add more agents/rules.

## 🏗️ How It Works  

1. **Define Inputs**  
   Each transaction is represented as a dictionary containing amount, origin, and destination details.  

2. **Build Analysis Task**  
   A CrewAI `Task` is created that instructs the agent to analyze the transaction.  

3. **Run Crew**  
   The `Crew` executes tasks sequentially and generates analysis.  

4. **Markdown Output**  
   Instead of JSON or raw text, the result is structured directly in **Markdown format**.

## 🔮 Future Improvements  

- Add multiple **risk factors** (fraud detection, blacklisted banks, unusual patterns).  
- Support for **multi-agent collaboration** (compliance agent, fraud agent, financial analyst).  
- Integration with **real transaction APIs** (Swift, UPI, PayPal).
